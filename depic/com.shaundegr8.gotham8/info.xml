		<description>A minimalist theme designed by a minimalist for minimalists</description>
		<description>This theme was originally designed by WinnenonSword but support was dropped... As an effort to keep this theme alive the community at /r/iOSThemes now manages it, there are many copies floating around though this one in my current knowledge holds the most icons! A good amount were designed by me!</description>
